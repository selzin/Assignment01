	 <p id="content"> The purpose of this paper was to see the changes that have occurred in technical when new approaches 
	 are coming and the online search are keeping going forward by measuring online diversity and democracy.
	 Ant the mainly focus in the current state of the online web search engine.</p> 
	 
    <p id="content">The search engine is different from current state with the decade before.
     They mark online information as important and their specials are shaped by market forces only. 
	 Introna and Nissenbaum had facilitated and correct these weaknesses of a search market i.e</p>
	 <ol>
	   <li>Public oversight of web search engine operation.</li>
       <li>Algorithm transparency.</li>
	 </ol>

    <p id="content">Search algorithm is used in the automatic choices inherent of source diversity. Since search engine
	is hidden, by algorithm transparency the search engine must disclose exactly how the ranking and indexing of 
	information on the online works since to rank the web search. For the personal web search companies, they keep
	confidential while disclosing generalities because of quality and competition in the search market. 
    Intorna and Nissenbaum point of view they feel that transparency is so important in order to rank the search engine 
	since knowing the details would increase the qualities of site owners. They also explained three major rules that used 
	in search engine algorithm i.e i. Linguistic cues,ii. Popularity cues and iii. User behavior cues.</p>

    <p id="content">The conclusion to this paper was researchers are trying to understand the relationship between
	online diversity and web search engines. Web search engine is not the best practices since it cannot extended 
	immediately rather it is recommended that it is more appropriate to assess the degree if diversity in online 
	search since the query must be evaluated separately within individual market and full right is given to the online
	searchers.</p>
