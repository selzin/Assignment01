      <h4 id="content">Abstract</h4>
      <p id="content">In "The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual web search engine" by Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page explains that
	  GOOGLE is the web search engine that stores the large amount of web pages or documents uploaded by huge number
	  of users and it is designed in such a way that it overcomes the limitation of existing systems. 
	  It clearly explains that google is a prototype that can crawl and produce satisfying web search results for the users.</p>

     <h4 id="content">Introduction</h4>
     <p id="content">This paper explains that as number of population is increasing the users on Web is also increasing rapidly.
	 In the olden days, World Wide Web Worm(wwww) is used to store the web documents. 
	 Since wwww has several limitations such as, storage space, Fast crawling technology, hardware performance,
	 changes in new technologies etc... so author claimed that Google is design to overcome all those limitation
	 and the term GOOGLE is designed with aim to improve the quality of web search engines. Data structures on 
	 Google are also optimized for efficient access and fast access. In the olden days some of the people believed that 
	 to find anything on the search engine can be easily done but nowadays due to increasing the number of documents 
	 and people are willing to look only at first top ten of results, the very high precision tool is required to 
	 fulfill the userâ€™s requirement. Authors explains that nowadays most of the web servers are migrating to 
	 commercial domains so with help of google it will migrate back to academic domains and most of the people can
	 able to used it. The final aim of this paper is to design a google that support large scale web data by novel
	 research activities.</p>

     <h4 id="content">System features</h4>
     <p id="content">Authors explains that the link structure and anchor text both are used in the google. The link structure will 
	 measure the quality ranking for individual web page and is called PageRank. PageRank helps to prioritize the outcome 
	 of web keyword searches and also helps in google system. Simple iterative algorithm is used in PageRank and it is
	 considered as the sum of all the web pages is equal to one in PageRank. Anchors text has several advantages since
	 anchor provide more accurate description and it may exist for documents which cannot be indexed. Propagating anchor text helps provide better quality results. It is technically difficult if anchor
	 text is used efficiently due to large numbers of data that must be processed.</p>

	 <h4 id="content">System anatomy</h4>
     <p id="content">Author explains the overview of high level Google architecture how it works in whole system. 
	 The language use in the Google is c/c++ and the system that runs the google is either Linux /Solaris system.
	 Flow of high level google architecture:</p>
		<p id="content">URL server -> Crawler -> Store server -> Repository -> Indexer ->(Anchor, Doc index, Barrels, Lexicon)</p>
		<p id="content">Anchor ->URL Resolver -> Links -> Pagerank ->Searcher</p>
		<p id="content">Doc Index (go back to URL server)-> Searcher</p>
		<p id="content">Barrels <->sorter -> Searcher</p>
		<p id="content"> Lexicon - > Searcher</p>
		<p id="content">Authors explains that google has a fast-distributed crawling (downloading web pages) system and providing 
		quality search results is the goals of searching in the Google.</p>

	 <h4 id="content">Results and Performance</h4>
      <p id="content">Google shows the better performance than the other commercial search engines and all the results are so 
	  high-quality web pages. The important for google search engine is to index and crawled efficiently so that the 
	  latest information will be up to date. And Google in 1998 it compressed its repository to about 53GB.</p>
 
    <h4 id="content">Conclusion</h4> 
    <p id="content"> The first goal of google is to provide high quality web search engine and improves the search quality as
	well and it is deigned in such a way that scalable large search engine. Its also the complete architecture that 
	collects all the web pages or information by indexing them while entering by several users.
    The future work of this paper is to improve the efficiency, include the query caching, smart disk allocation 
	and sub-indices. And also, to used proxy caches in google.</p>
