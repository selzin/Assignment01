	  <p id="univeristyname" style="font-size:20px;"><b>Summary</b></p>	 
   	 
     <p id="content"> The purpose of this review article was to determine the importance of Web page in terms of the importance assigned
	 to the pages hyperlinking to it of the PageRank and the PageRank is the fundamental ingredient in the process of making 
	 the Google search engine.</p> 

     <p id="content">Latest web search engine is dynamic, large storage, hyper-linked and self-organized data source but in olden days 
	 those features are not implemented in the web so its very different from traditional web/ document collections.</p>

     <p id="content"> In ranking web pages using PageRank if it is pointed to by other pages the web page is important and there
	 are three factors that determine the PageRank of the Page.</p>
	 <ol>
	 <li>The number of links it receives.</li>
     <li>The number of outgoing links of linking pages.</li>
     <li>The PageRank of the linking pages.</li>
	 </ol>	 
    <p id="content"> All pages are not equally created and the more valuable pages are created when links from important pages.</p>

   <p id="content">It has got two problems for this ideal model i.e the first one is if pages have no forward links it causes a
   problem and so-called presence of dangling nodes. The second one is web surfer can get trapped into bucket of the 
   graph of web. These problems are solved by using google matrix.
   The paper explains how it solve the problems using PageRank vector and got the same result as Markov theory.
   The history of PageRank is also given with year, name of Author and its Contribution towards effectively
   solving the PageRank Problem.</p>

  <p id="content">Under the standing on the shoulders of giant author explains different subtopics such as, Hubs and authorities 
  on the web where HITS (Hypertext Induced Topic Search) is explained, Bibliometrics (also called scientometrics), 
  Sociometry and Econometrics.</p>

  <p id="content">The major conclusion to this review article was original notion of information with quality was found on the web is
  introduced in the PageRank and they have consider the differences between collective and expert evaluation.
  Expert evaluation consists in evaluation given by peer experts working in the like field whereas collective is
  in estimating the importance of contribution though publication from the university. 
  Bibliometric indicator is inspired by PageRank. Nowadays it is shifted from peer-review 
  (means focusing on other thing than research quality) to bibliometric evaluation 
  (choice of indicators, time span, organizational lever).</p>
